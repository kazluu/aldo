# Aldo Invoice Tracking and Confirmation Feature

## Overview
Add an automatic invoice generation system to the existing Aldo CLI app that tracks which work periods have been invoiced and provides a seamless workflow for generating invoices without manual date entry.

## New Features

### 1. Enhanced Invoice Generation
Modify the existing `aldo generate-invoice` command to support two modes:

**Manual Mode (existing behavior):**
```
aldo generate-invoice [START_DATE] [END_DATE]
```

**Automatic Mode (new behavior):**
```
aldo generate-invoice
```
- When called without arguments, automatically generate an invoice for all logged work since the last confirmed invoice
- Use the confirmation date from the most recent `aldo confirm` command as the starting point
- If no previous confirmation exists, include all logged work from the beginning

### 2. New Invoice Confirmation Command
Add a new command to track which invoices have been sent/confirmed:

```
aldo confirm [INVOICE_NUMBER]
```

**Command behavior:**
1. **Validation**: Verify that the provided invoice number matches the next expected invoice number in sequence
   - If numbers match: Proceed with confirmation
   - If numbers don't match: Display error message stating "Only the latest invoice can be confirmed" with the expected number

2. **State Updates**: When confirmation is successful:
   - Increment the next invoice number counter (by 10, following existing logic)
   - Store the current date as the "last confirmation date"
   - This date becomes the cutoff point for future automatic invoice generation

### 3. Invoice Tracking System
Implement persistent storage to track:
- Last confirmed invoice number
- Date of last invoice confirmation
- Next invoice number to be generated

**Data Requirements:**
- Track confirmation dates to determine work period boundaries
- Maintain invoice number sequence integrity
- Store this information in the existing data persistence system

## Implementation Notes
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing manual invoice generation
- The automatic mode should only include work logged after the last confirmation date
- If using automatic mode and no work exists since last confirmation, display appropriate message
- Update help documentation to explain both manual and automatic invoice generation modes

## Example Workflow
```bash
# Log some work
aldo log today 8
aldo log yesterday 6

# Generate first invoice (includes all work)
aldo generate-invoice
# → Generates invoice #1000

# Confirm the invoice was sent
aldo confirm 1000
# → Sets cutoff date to today, next invoice will be #1010

# Log more work
aldo log tomorrow 4

# Generate next invoice automatically
aldo generate-invoice
# → Generates invoice #1010 with only work since confirmation

# Confirm second invoice
aldo confirm 1010
# → Updates cutoff date, next invoice will be #1020
```
